'''QUESTION 1

Create a python program to prompt the user for hours and hourly rates to compute gross pay. 
For now, please donâ€™t worry about making sure the pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. 
If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

Enter Hours: 35 
Enter Rate: 2.75 
Pay: 96.25'''

#initialise variables for user inputs
hours = float(input("Enter numbers of hours worked: "))
rate = float(input("Enter hourly rate: "))

grossPay = (hours * rate)
print("The gross pay is","{:.2f}".format(grossPay)) #format output to 2 decimal places
