"""QUESTION 4

Write a Python that takes two numbers from the userA and userB.
The program should compute the sum of all even numbers between a and b. 
Assume that a and b are non-negative integers. Both numbers can be any non-negative integer

#initialise variables for user inputs
#by setting boundaries for the user input, it will make sure that the program runs smoothly
