'''4.	Write an algorithm that reads in two numbers: alpha and beta. 
The first number MUST be negative, while the second number MUST be positive. 
Your algorithm should calculate the square roots of all numbers in the range of alpha and beta (including the boundaries, i.e. including alpha and beta).'''


1. START
2. READ alphaNumber = negative user input
3. READ betaNumber = positive user input
4. SET VARIABLES,  START_RANGE = alphaNumber, END_RANGE = betaNumber
5. IMPORT MATH
6.1. FOR i IN RANGE (alphaNumber, including betaNumber)
    6.1.1. number = SQUARE ROOT OF i
        6.1.2 IF i > 0 THEN 
            6.1.3 DISPLAY number
            6.2. ELSE
                6.2.1 DISPLAY "ERROR"
